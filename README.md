# Root_traits_SoilWaterGradient
## Code and data for Hoysagk et al.

This repository contains the code and data for the analysis of root traits along a soil water (groundwater) gradient.

## Overview

The project investigates how root morphological traits and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) colonization vary across a groundwater level gradient. The repository provides a full reproducible workflow for statistical modeling, visualization, and result export.

## Repository Structure

- **analyses/** – R scripts for data processing, statistical analysis, and plotting.
 See the [analyses/README.md](analyses/README.md) for details:
    - **(G)LM_models.R:** Fitting and comparing linear and generalized linear models (LM/GLM) for root trait responses to environmental variables.
    - **RDA.R:** Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to explore multivariate relationships between root traits and environmental gradients.
    - **correlation_root_traits.R:** Computing and visualizing correlations between root traits.
- **figures/** – Output figures generated by the analysis scripts.
- **tables/** – CSV tables summarizing model results and statistical tests.
- **.gitignore** – Specifies files and folders to be ignored by git.
- **README.md** – This documentation file.
- **Root_traits_SoilWaterGradient.Rproj** – RStudio project file for easy project management.
